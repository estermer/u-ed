With a new decentralized internet on the horizon through [Blockstack](http://blockstack.org),
there is now a way to bring the power of data back into the hands of users.

In education there are 2 major problems:

1. Schools serve as data silos.

Schools own student records.

In the case of natural disasters, data can be lost. We saw this when Katrina
hit New Orleans and many people lost there high school and college transcripts. 

When students need to attend another school, they must go through a extremely difficult
and time consuming process to get their coursework sent to schools for admissions.

When seeking employment, seeking and completing a degree is more important than gathering
the necessary skills for employment.


2. High cost.

Subsidies for students and a culture pushing college for employment has
created a distorted market and increased the cost of college dramatically.

In just a generation, college went from being payed for by savings and summer jobs to a mini mortgage.

***The Escape***

To escape these two problems in our education system we have to make choice more advantageous and put the records 
back into the hands of students.

When a student can control his/her own records, they are more mobile when it comes to their education.
They can pick and choose courses from many different schools and build a portfolio of skills gained
that they can show to employers. This way the emphasis is on the students skills gained rather than 
jumping through the hoops of the school. Also students are free to choose alternative methods of education
such as online coursework to further build their portfolio.

This increased mobility of education will create better competition among schools and ultimately reduce costs
and take the emphasis off of only a single method of education.
